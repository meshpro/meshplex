meshplex --- Simplex meshes for Python
======================================

meshplex computes all sorts of interesting points, areas, and volumes in triangular and
tetrahedral meshes, with a focus on efficiency. Useful in many contexts, e.g.,
finite-element and finite-volume computations.

For a quickstart, checkout `meshplex's GitHubPage <//github.com/nschloe/meshplex>`_.
